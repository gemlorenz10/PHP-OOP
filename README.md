      This project is used for educational purposes only. 
    I'm a complete beginner I will consider any advice from you.
    These are the examples I made to get my hands dirty while studying PHP.

## DOCUMENTATION
- [Supporting document of the study](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11uEkJlI-CwHJp4_AttPo3lRsObEZsfArG-3OVFt1j1M/edit#heading=h.jpuant2xbsab) - Can only be open for specific people.

- [PHP.net Official PHP Website](http://php.net/) - It's always best to refer on the main website of php.
